# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

*This project is about implementing singly linked lists in C programming language. The project consists of several tasks, each with a different objective related to linked lists. The first task is to write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list. The second task is to write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list. The third task is to write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list. The fourth task is to write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list. The fifth task is to write a function that frees a list_t list. The last task is to write a function that adds a new node at the end of a sorted list_t list.*



*The main objective of this project is to understand the concept of linked lists and their advantages over arrays. The project aims to help the learner understand how to build and use linked lists in C. The project also focuses on the proper use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and function implementation.*
