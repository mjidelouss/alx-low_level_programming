# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

________________________


**The project 0x0C. C - More malloc, free is a software development project written in the C programming language. The project is focused on exploring the concepts of memory allocation, automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free. The main objectives of the project are:**

* *To teach how to use the exit function*
* *To teach what are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them*
* *To learn how to allocate memory using malloc*
* *To concatenate two strings using malloc*

***The project consists of several mandatory tasks:***

* **`Task 0`** Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.
* **`Task 1`**  Write a function that creates a dynamic array of integers using malloc.


**The project emphasizes proper memory management, using only allowed C standard library functions such as malloc, free, and exit. The code must conform to the Betty style and should not use global variables, with no more than 5 functions per file. The project requires the inclusion of a header file containing the function prototypes and the _putchar function. Additionally, a README.md file must be included in the project directory.**
