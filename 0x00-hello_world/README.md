### 0. Preprocessor

**A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE; The output should be saved in the file c using :**

```c
	gcc -E $CFILE -o c
```

*The command **`gcc -E $CFILE -o c`** is a command to preprocess a C file using the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler.*

**The options and arguments used in this command are:**

* **`gcc`** *The command to invoke the GCC compiler.*
* **`-E`** *The option to instruct the compiler to perform only the preprocessing stage of the compilation process. This means that the preprocessor will process the source code and output an expanded version of the code, with all preprocessor directives (#include, #define, #ifdef, etc.) replaced with their corresponding code.*
* **`CFILE`** *This is a shell variable that holds the name of the C file to be preprocessed. The variable is expanded to the file name at runtime.*

* **`-o c`** *This option specifies the name of the output file. In this case, the output file is named `c`*

*Therefore, when you run this command, the GCC compiler preprocesses the C file specified by the $CFILE variable and generates an expanded version of the code, which is then saved to the file named c. This command can be useful for examining the output of the preprocessor, debugging preprocessor directives, or generating intermediate code for further analysis.*

### 1. Compiler

**A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE; The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.**

**Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s using :**

```c
	gcc -c $CFILE
```

*The command **`gcc -c $CFILE`** is used to compile a C source file into an object file.*

*The `gcc` command is the GNU Compiler Collection, a popular compiler for C and C++ programming languages. The `-c` option tells the compiler to generate an object file instead of an executable file.*

*The `$CFILE` variable is used to specify the C source file to be compiled. The variable is expanded by the shell and replaced with the actual value before the `gcc` command is executed. So, for example, if the variable is set to `main.c`, then the command **`gcc -c $CFILE`** will compile `main.c` into an object file.*

*When `gcc` compiles a C file with the `-c` option, it generates an object file with the same base name as the C file, but with the extension `.o`. So, for example, if the C file is named `main.c`, then the object file generated by the command `gcc -c main.c` will be named `main.o`. The object file contains machine code that has been translated from the C source code, but it is not yet linked into an executable.*

### 2. Assembler

**A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE; The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.**

**Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s using :**

```bash
	gcc -S $CFILE
```

***`gcc -S $CFILE`** is a command to generate assembly code from a C source file.*

*The `-S` option tells the compiler to stop after generating the assembly code, and not to proceed with the compilation and linking steps. The `$CFILE` variable is the name of the C source file that you want to generate the assembly code for.*

*This command will output the generated assembly code to the standard output. You can redirect the output to a file using `>` operator, for example `gcc -S $CFILE > $ASSEMBLY_FILE` will save the assembly code to a file named `$ASSEMBLY_FILE`.*
