**This is a project for the C programming language. The project involves working with dynamic memory allocation using the malloc() and free() functions in C. The project aims to teach the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, how to use malloc() and free() functions and when to use them. The student is also expected to learn how to use Valgrind to check for memory leaks.**
