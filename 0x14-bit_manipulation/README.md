# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

**This project covers the concept of bit manipulation in C programming language. The following topics are covered in this project:**

* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.
* Binary representation of unsigned integers.
* Bitwise operations and shifts in C.
* Creation of functions to work with bits.

## Tasks

**0.0**

*Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.*

* Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b).
* b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars.
* Return: the converted number, or 0 if there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1, or if b is NULL.
